Title: About
Slug: about

ðŸ‘‹  Josh, here. I use this space to string together chunks of words on data-related topics. 

I'm interested in solving problems based on data and analysis. I have soft spots for the shell command line and Python, and occasionally get to play with heavier tools, as needed. ðŸ’» ðŸ“Š ðŸ“ˆ 

If you're curious about where I've been, [you might check here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuamontague). If you're interested in what I'm doing right now, [you might look over here](https://twitter.com/jrmontag). 

If you'd like to see some of the presentations and public speaking I've done, [hop on over to the Talks](http://joshmontague.com/pages/talks) page. 

Other than that, most of the good stuff is right up front, [on the main page](http://joshmontague.com/).
