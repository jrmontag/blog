For quick, get-up-and-running web publishing, there is [obviously](http://tumblr.com) [no](http://wordpress.com) [shortage](http://blogger.com) [of](http://medium.com) [platforms](http://ghost.org) [out](http://subtle.com) there to use (plus a million options I've never heard of). I've certainly started and neglected my share of these platforms (or had them go away... RIP [posterous](posterous.com)). In my latest endeavor to share things -- driven by excitement about my new work universe -- I was looking for a combination of "get your hands dirty" and "keep it lightweight". Ultimately, I went for a Pelican-based solution hosted by GitHub Pages -- this thing right here. It's still in its infancy (heck, I haven't even changed the default theme yet), but so far the learning curve hasn't been too steep. There are some components that are still new to me, so I'm learning as I go. This edition of Weekend Project is just about getting the pieces up and running -- better understanding will hopefully come down the road.

I kicked this project off by reading two great posts by Martin Brochhaus ([newer](http://martinbrochhaus.com/pelican2.html), [older](http://martinbrochhaus.com/pelican.html)), and then supplemented those with the various official docs along the way. Links are included throughout if you want to peruse, as well.
