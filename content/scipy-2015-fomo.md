Summary: Catching up on the great content from SciPy2015 without having attended the conference. 

Learning new things is incredible. Especially when you get to the point of building on top of growing skills in a particular domain. Over the last couple of years, I've learned a lot about Python, in particular for use in data science and analysis. I also really enjoy socializing with peers from the field at conferences, and the one Python-specific conference I attended (PyCon 2014) was a blast. Super friendly attendees, and also getting the chance to meet - in person - with folks who only previously manifested on Twitter and websites.

Unfortunately, I can't attend every interesting conference. So when I saw that [SciPy 2015](http://scipy2015.scipy.org/) just taking place in Austin, Texas this week, I felt a little bit of [FOMO](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=fomo) for all the great stuff that was being presented. But, I was pleased to see a relatively consistent hashtag being used ([#SciPy2015](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23scipy2015&src=tyah&vertical=default&f=tweets)) to tie together content that was being shared on Twitter. One of the many reasons I love using Twitter for my professional development, is that so many people use it to share the new and interesting things they experience. 

Knowing that the next best thing to being there is to see the code, slide decks, and possibly video, [I shared a Twitter search](https://twitter.com/jrmontag/status/619184310663294977) that I was using to occasionally check in on new content. That search was great while the conference was happening, but after the event is over the real-time search will be less helpful. So, today I saved [a more specific version of the same search](https://twitter.com/search/?q=tutorial+OR+slides+OR+code+%23scipy2015+lang%3Aen+since%3A2015-07-06+until%3A2015-07-14+filter%3Alinks) that includes a bit of the advanced search functionality:

- requires #SciPy2015 hashtag
- requires one of: tutorial, code, slides
- <strike>requires that the Tweet include a link</strike> (this search feature doesn't appear to work any longer)
- requires that the Tweet is in English
- excludes Retweets
- uses time windowing to focus on that one week (plus a couple of days)

This way I can return to the results and consume them at whatever pace I need. If the embedded version of the search below isn't working, you can also just [click here to run the search at Twitter.com](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23scipy2015%20%28tutorial%20OR%20slides%20OR%20code%29%20lang%3Aen%20since%3A2015-07-06%20until%3A2015-07-14%20exclude%3Aretweets%20&src=typd).

Of note, Enthought also does a wonderful job of quickly getting the video recordings of the talks into [a super convenient playlist on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYx7XA2nY5Gcpabmu61kKcToLz0FapmHu).
